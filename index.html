            The Internet as a Global Shared Space
        </h1>
        <p>
            The internet is a unique worldwide common ground.
            Despite physical distance being irrelevant, the concept of space remains - 
            this is what the article explores but I donâ€™t see why this analogy is important.
        </p>
        <h1>Monopoly and Centralization</h1>
        <p>
            Google's dominance in search forms an internet monopoly, centralizing control.
            This raises concerns about power and potential exploitation.
        </p>
        <h1>Challenges to Internet Unity</h1>
        <p>
            The internet is unified but subject to varying laws, blurring its unity.
        </p>
        <h1>Addressing Monopolies and Centralization</h1>
        <p>
            Solutions for internet monopolies like Google's are necessary.
            Exploring a decentralized internet is a potential remedy.
        </p>
        <h1>Decentralized Social Networks</h1>
        <p>
            Mastodon and similar platforms offer alternatives to centralized social networks.
            They aim to empower users and reduce tech giant influence - but there are risks
        </p>
        <h1>User Concerns and Exploitation</h1>
        <p>
            Critiquing internet design and user data exploitation is crucial 
            but the way this article presents it is not great - I think being straightforward would be more effective.
        </p>
        <h1>Presentation</h1>
        <p>The way this website is designed and the text is 
            presented is awful and distracting, making me less interested in the subject matter that I have always been curious about.
